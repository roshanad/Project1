Self-scoring Trivia

Objective: 

Pre-load your app with some questions and answers.

Test the user's wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

Bonus:

    Add time-based scoring
    Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
    Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.

As an user, I should be able to see the instructions so that I know rules before I play. As an user, I should be able to choose different topic so that I can challenge myself in each topic. As an user, I should be able to know how many questions I have answered correctly, so that I can track my progress. As an user, I should be able to know if I have answered correctly or not, so that I can learn about incorrect answers. As an user, I should be able to reset game, so that I can retake it.
